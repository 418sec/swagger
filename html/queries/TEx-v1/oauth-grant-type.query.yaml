    The method with which an access token will be obtained. While the OAuth 2.0
    spec allows for multiple grant types, currently only
    `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` is supported here, which
    indicates that a token exchange is being performed.

# default is useful here since this is the only possible value so having it as
# default means sdk users do not have to enter this value every time they make
# this call. However, in the general case we strongly discourage using default
# and it should never ever be used if the resource can be updated (i.e. it has
# a patch endpoint) as that can cause the user to update fields they didn't
# intend to.
