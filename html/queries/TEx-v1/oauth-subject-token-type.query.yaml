description: An identifier that indicates the type of the security
  token in the `subject_token` parameter. While the OAuth 2.0 spec allows for
  multiple subject token types, currently only
  `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt` is supported here, which indicates that
  the token is a JSON Web Token.
type: string
required: true
# default is useful here since this is the only possible value so having it as
# default means sdk users do not have to enter this value every time they make
# this call. However, in the general case we strongly discourage using default
# and it should never ever be used if the resource can be updated (i.e. it has
# a patch endpoint) as that can cause the user to update fields they didn't
# intend to.
