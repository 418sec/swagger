      The continuous replication feature is used for disaster recovery on FlashArray
      and provides a recovery point objective (RPO) of significantly less than 30s.

    description: Total bytes transmitted or received per second during resync replication.
      Resync replication is the mechanism to bring two arrays into sync. This may
      occur during an initial pod stretch, or, in case of outage, when two arrays
      reestablish connection. After the connection is restored, the array that was
      online starts replicating pod data to its peer array until the pod is once again
      in sync.
