      description: Returns a value of `true` if the remote protection group has been
        destroyed and is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays
        the amount of time left until the destroyed remote protection group is permanently
        eradicated. Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed
        remote protection group can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once
        the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the remote protection group is permanently
        eradicated and can no longer be recovered.
