      description: Returns a value of `true` if the protection group snapshot has
        been destroyed and is pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays
        the amount of time left until the destroyed snapshot is permanently eradicated.
        Before the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the destroyed snapshot can
        be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`. Once the `time_remaining` period
        has elapsed, the snapshot is permanently eradicated and can no longer be recovered.
