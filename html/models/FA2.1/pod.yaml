    arrays:
      description: A list of arrays over which the pod is stretched. If there are
        two or more arrays in the stretched pod, all data in the pod is synchronously
        replicated between all of the arrays within the pod.

    destroyed:
      description: Returns a value of `true` if the pod has been destroyed and is
        pending eradication. The `time_remaining` value displays the amount of time
        left until the destroyed pod is permanently eradicated. Before the `time_remaining`
        period has elapsed, the destroyed pod can be recovered by setting `destroyed=false`.
        Once the `time_remaining` period has elapsed, the pod is permanently eradicated
        and can no longer be recovered.

      description: Determines which array within a stretched pod should be given priority
        to stay online should the arrays ever lose contact with each other. The current
        array and any peer arrays that are connected to the current array for synchronous
        replication can be added to a pod for failover preference. By default, `failover_preferences=null`,
        meaning no arrays have been configured for failover preference.

      description: The maximum amount of physical space the pod would take up on any
        array, ignoring any data shared outside the pod. Measured in bytes. The footprint
