    connector_type:
      description: >-
        Form-factor of the interface.
        Possible values are QSFP, RJ-45 and SFP.
      type: string
      readOnly: true
      example: QSFP
    lane_speed:
      description: >-
        Configured speed of each lane in the connector in bits-per-second
      type: integer
      format: int64
      example: 10000000000
    port_count:
      description: Configured number of ports in the connector. (1/2/4 for QSFP)
      type: integer
      format: int64
      example: 2
    transceiver_type:
      description: >-
        Details about the transceiver which is plugged into the connector port.
        Transceiver type will be read-only for Pureuser. If nothing is plugged
        into QSFP port, value will be “Unused”. If a transceiver is plugged in,
        and type cannot be auto-detected,  and internal user has not specified
        a type - value will be “Unknown”.
        If transceiver is plugged in, and type is auto-detected, and/or type
        has been explicitly set by internal user - that value will be shown.
        Transceiver type is not applicable for RJ-45 connectors.
      type: string
      readOnly: true
      example: 40GBASE-LR4
