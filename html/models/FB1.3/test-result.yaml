      Possible values are phonehome, phonehome-ping, remote-assist, connecting,
      binding, rootdse-searching and [group]-searching.
      The directory-service test includes connecting, binding,
      rootdse-searching and [group]-searching tests.
      The [group] dynamically changes to the role name depending on which role
      the test is searching for. Possible values for group are
      array-admin-group, read-only-group, and storage-admin-group.
