    ## Confidential and Proprietary. Subject to NDA and End User Agreement.
    
    A light weight API for FlashBlade, developed by Pure Storage, Inc. (http://www.purestorage.com/).
    
    ## Authentication
    Use an api-token (header param) to start a session at /api/login, that returns an x-auth-token header which expires in 30 minutes by default. This is
    different than FlashArray, which uses a cookie instead.  The x-auth-token is saved and added by the built in proxy server.
    
    Use "pureadmin create" on the CLI to create an API Token.  Or use "pureadmin list --api-token --expose" to show a token already created.  Note, it will only shows tokens for the logged in user.

    ## Proxy
    This Swagger tool includes a proxy server that forwards API calls to the array.  In the Swagger UI, you will \
    see curl API calls to IP 127.0.0.1, that is the proxy server. To see the API call details view the console output.

    ## Error Codes
    Use HTTP Response codes to determine command results.  Error message json formats are different depending on the endpoint.
